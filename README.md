# ðŸŒ± Carbon Offset Calculator (SPA + PWA)

## ðŸ“˜ Project Brief

Create a **Single Page Application (SPA)** that estimates a userâ€™s carbon footprint based on travel and energy use, and calculates how many trees are needed to offset it. The app must also be a fully functional **Progressive Web App (PWA)** â€” installable, offline-ready, and mobile-friendly.

## âœ… Requirements

### Core Features
- **Form Inputs**:
  - Mode of transport: Car, Plane, Train
  - Distance traveled (in kilometers or miles)
  - Monthly electricity usage (in kWh)

- **Results Display**:
  - Total estimated carbon emissions (in kg COâ‚‚)
  - Number of trees required to offset that amount annually

- **UI/UX**:
  - Responsive, mobile-first layout
  - Real-time or triggered result display

### Technical Requirements
- Built as a **SPA** using your preferred stack (e.g. Vanilla JS / React / Vue / Svelte)
- Implement as a **PWA**:
  - Web app manifest
  - Service worker with offline support
  - Installable on devices
- Store user input or calculation history using `localStorage` or `IndexedDB`

## ðŸŒŸ Bonus Features (Optional)
- Dark mode toggle
- Save and view past calculations
- Basic animation/transition for result reveal
- Deploy the app publicly (e.g. Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages)

## ðŸ“Š Sample Emission Factors

| Mode of Transport | Emissions (per km) |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Car               | 0.21 kg COâ‚‚        |
| Plane             | 0.15 kg COâ‚‚        |
| Train             | 0.05 kg COâ‚‚        |

**Tree Offset Assumption:** One mature tree absorbs ~21 kg COâ‚‚ per year.
